git init initializes the repository meta data

the staging area holds files to commit, the working directory is where local files are stored. the staging area allows control of what and when files are commited

by using add for changed files per logical change and commit when the logical change is finished or needs testing

branches are natural points of divergence from the main development sequence making testing and development outside the main sequence and allowing for each seperate sequence to be tracked

Diagrams reduce the detail level (from commit id) to overall branch structure and can identify unreachable nodes for each branch

Merging two branches incorporates all changes in both branches to be merged into one branch and the full history to be accesed in log, the diagram shows both aspects

Auto merging when unambiguous is great maual merging when ambiguous avoids bugs and lost work
